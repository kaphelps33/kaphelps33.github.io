        <strong>Peronal Background: </strong>I have lived in Charlotte my
        whole life and I have been at UNCC for two years. I like to run, read,
        and I enjoy anything involving music and can play multiple
        instruments. I enjoy learning new things especially languages, math,
        and science.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Professional Background: </strong>I have worked since I was 18
        years old at a surveying firm. I have done thousands of land surveys
        in both North and South Carolina and have tons of experience in
        AutoCAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Academic Background: </strong>I graduated from CPCC with my
        Associates in Arts degree focused on mathematics in 2022. Now I
        graduate this semester with by BS in computer science, concentration
        in software, systems, and networks with the intent of going to medical
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Programming/Software Background: </strong>I have the most
        experience with Java and C. I have used Python, JavaScript, C++, and
        Swift a lot. I do have experience with both HTML and CSS and also with
        the React framework. I turn VIM keybindings on for everything that I
        possibly can.
      </p>

          wanted to further my knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ITSC 4155 - Software Development Projects: </strong>I need
