        <strong>Peronal Background: </strong>I have lived in Charlotte my
        whole life and I have been at UNCC for two years. I like to run, read,
        and I enjoy anything involving music and can play multiple
        instruments. I enjoy learning new things especially languages, math,
        and science.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Professional Background: </strong>I have worked since I was 18
        years old at a surveying firm. I have done thousands of land surveys
        in both North and South Carolina and have tons of experience in
        AutoCAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Academic Background: </strong>I graduated from CPCC with my
        Associates in Arts degree focused on mathematics in 2022. Now I
        graduate this semester with by BS in computer science, concentration
        in software, systems, and networks with the intent of going to medical
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Programming/Software Background: </strong>I have the most
        experience with Java and C. I have used Python, JavaScript, C++, and
        Swift a lot. I do have experience with both HTML and CSS and also with
        the React framework. I turn VIM keybindings on for everything that I
        possibly can.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>MacOS</p>
      <p><strong>Courses I'm taking and why: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development: </strong>I liked
          designing web applications in my software engineering class and I
          wanted to further my knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ITSC 4155 - Software Development Projects: </strong>I need
          the class to graduate, it is my capstone project.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Funny/interesting Item to Remember Me by: I can solve a Rubix cube in under 30 seconds (17 is my best).</p>

        <h3>Contract</h3>
        <p>
          I, Kelsey A. Phelps agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
          in my Fall 2024, ITIS 3135 class with my instructor, Professor D.I.
          von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly
          available online tools will be available to the world, and will not
          put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I
          wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts
          for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure
          to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that
          given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find
          many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I
          swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
          and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e.
          external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed:
          <em>Kelsey A. Phelps</em>
