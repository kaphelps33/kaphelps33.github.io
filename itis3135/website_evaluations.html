    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <section>
      <h3><a href="apple.com">Apple</a></h3>
      <p>The Apple website is, of course, designed very well. It features a navigation bar at the top on all pages so
        that a user can easily jump form one page to another. When one hover over these navigation links, the main page
        is blurred and a drop down menu displays. Everything is well designed with sleek, modern looks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Contrast is used to highlight important elements on the page. The color scheme
          features a clean background with dark text and vibrant accents. </li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts and style for links and images are used consistently which provide a
          cohesive experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Text, images, and other elements are thoughtfully aligned. There are some areas
          that utilize asymmetric design, however it does not disrupt uniformity to much.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is group well allowing users to understand relationships between
          elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Lings Cars</a></h3>
      <p>Links Cars is a website that focuses on car rentals. Using this website is similar to using a computer in the
        early 2000s. The background image is extreme, there are animations galore, and styles are all over the place.
        Honestly, the sight has a lot of character and I like it, but based on the principals of judgment, it is not
        designed well.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Contrast is utilized in most places, but there are some places where text is very
          bright against a very dark background.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is not much consistent styling. Most buttons are the same as well has
          image styling, but things are very random.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment is not used very well. There are places where text is overflowing the
          borders, and is center aligned. The logo list also causes huge amounts of dead space at the bottom of the
          page.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is used pretty well, the pictures of the cars and their information is
          all grouped with each other and in similar fashion, as well as navigation links being close together.</li>
