    <section id="what">
      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>A synthesizer is an electronic device that generates sound through the manipulation of electrical signals. This
        process can be understood scientifically through the lens of waveforms, signal processing, and acoustics.</p>
      <p>At its core, sound is a vibration that travels through a medium (like air) and is interpreted by our ears as
        pressure waves. These waves can be represented mathematically as functions of time, often using sine and cosine
        functions to describe the waveforms. A synthesizer takes advantage of this by generating and manipulating
        electrical signals to create a wide range of sounds. These signals can then be amplified and converted into
        sound waves by a speaker.</p>

      <h2>When</h2>
      <h3>Synthesizers the instrument of yesterday, today, and tomorrow</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>1897: The Telharmonium</h4>
        <p>The Telharmonium, invented by Thaddeus Cahill, was the first electronic instrument and a precursor to the
          synthesizer. This large, complex machine created sound by generating electrical signals and converting them
          into sound through telephone receivers.</p>

      <h2>Where</h2>
      <h3>Where to find, experience, and learn about synthesizers</h3>
      <h4>Learning</h4>
      <p>To learn about synthesizers you must first learn about <em>synthesis</em>. A great, modern resource for this is
        <a href="https://www.syntorial.com/">Syntorial</a>, a website that teaches you to make synth patches by ear.
      </p>
      <h4>Your first synth</h4>
      <p>Your first synth should probably free, digital one instead of a $2,000+, 30lbs analog beast. Here are some that
        I can recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://vital.audio/">Vital</a> - This is a digital wavetable synth that will give you digital
          sounds.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/">OB-Xd</a> - This is an analog emulation of the Oberheim OB-X</li>
      </ul>

        music to the most beautiful or unchained places.
        There’s always something new to explore in the world of synthesis.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="how">
      <h2>How</h2>
      <h3>How to Get the Most Out of Your Synthesizers</h3>
      <h4>Assumptions</h4>
      <p>This super brief guide is written in the hopes that you already have:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Listed to synth music (be that '80s, synthwave, etc...) ever.</li>
        <li>Have at least <em>some</em> understanding of music theory.</li>
        <li>Possibly have experience playing the piano (will cut learning time in half).</li>
        <li>Have a synth!</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Avoid GAS!</h4>
      <p>Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) is a common phenomenon among musicians and synth enthusiasts, characterized by
        an unquenchable thirst to acquire more equipment. While it's natural to want the latest synths and gear,
        constantly chasing new items can lead to financial strain and distract from your primary goal: making music. To
        combat GAS, start by focusing on mastering the tools you currently have. Take the time to explore all the
        features of your synths and experiment with sound design, rather than immediately looking to purchase the next
        creativity and expression, not just accumulating equipment. GAS can <em>ruin</em> the musical experience and has
        for <em>a lot</em> of people. Don't be one of them!</p>

      <h4>Understanding Signal Flow</h4>
      <figure>
        <a title="Synthesizer.components.01.png: Scriber
derivative work: User:Clusternote, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons"
          href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Synthesizer.components.01.svg"><img width="1000"
            alt="Synthesizer.components.01"
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Synthesizer.components.01.svg/512px-Synthesizer.components.01.svg.png?20180225015552"></a>
        <caption>A brief guide to signal flow</caption>
      </figure>
      <p>Before diving into sound design, it's crucial to grasp the basics of signal flow. Understanding how sound
        travels through the different modules of your synth—oscillators, filters, envelopes, and effects—will empower
        you to create unique sounds. Start with simple patches and gradually explore more complex routing to develop
        your skills. (Refer to my writings above about learning synthesis)</p>

      <h4>Experimenting with Patches</h4>
      <p>Don’t hesitate to tweak presets and experiment with different parameters. Try adjusting oscillator waveforms,
        filter cutoff, and modulation settings to see how they affect the sound. Remember, some of the best sounds come
        from unexpected settings!</p>

      <h4>Layering Sounds</h4>
      <p>One effective technique in synthesizer sound design is layering multiple sounds together. This could involve
        using two different synths or layering multiple instances of the same synth. Experiment with slightly detuning
        them or using different waveforms to create a richer, fuller sound.</p>

      <h4>Using MIDI Effectively</h4>
      <p>MIDI is a powerful tool when it comes to controlling your synthesizers. Learn to use MIDI controllers and
        sequencers to manipulate your sounds. You can automate parameters and create intricate patterns that add depth
        to your compositions.</p>

      <h4>Exploring Effects</h4>
      <p>Don't overlook the impact of effects like reverb, delay, and distortion. These can dramatically change the
        character of your sound. Invest time in learning how to effectively use these effects within your signal chain
        to enhance your overall sound design.</p>

      <h4>Joining Communities</h4>
      <p>Engaging with online communities can significantly enhance your synthesizer journey. Platforms like <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/">Reddit's r/synthesizers</a> and forums such as <a
          href="https://gearspace.com/">Gearspace</a> are great places to share your experiences, ask for advice, and
        discover new techniques from fellow enthusiasts.</p>

      <h4>Keeping Up with Trends</h4>
      <p>The synthesizer world is always evolving, with new gear and techniques emerging regularly. Follow blogs,
        YouTube channels, and social media influencers in the synth community to stay informed about the latest trends
        and innovations.</p>

      <h4>Experimenting with Different Genres</h4>
      <p>Don’t limit yourself to one style of music. Experiment with synthesizers across various genres, from electronic
        to ambient, to discover new sounds and techniques that inspire you. Each genre has its unique approach to sound
        design that can enhance your creativity.</p>

      <h4>Avoiding Snobbery</h4>
      <p>So many people get so caught up in their synth "camps" and how they do things that they ruin it for everyone
        else. Music is subjective, do what you want to do and what makes you happy. So many famous songs that inspire
        everyone today were made using unorthodox techniques. Don't get so caught up in how its supposed to be done that
        you forget why you do it in the first place.</p>
