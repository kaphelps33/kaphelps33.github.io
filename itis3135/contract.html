    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <section>
      <p>I, Kelsey A. Phelps agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, ITIS 3135 class
        with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available
        online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for
        schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
        not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also
        understand
        that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my
        classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste
        code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
      <p>Signed:</p>
      <em>Kelsey A. Phelps, September 13, 2024</em>
